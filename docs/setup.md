# First Time Setup

**Needs**

A **terminal** (also the one inside VScode or something is fine). A **code editor** (VScode, Cursor, whatever). A **vercel** account. A **github** account (ideally I'd link this to your code editor so it's easier to use).

| **Package** | **Why**          | **???** |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ------- |
| Bun         | because YES      |
| Vercel      | CI/CD, Functions |

```shell
pnpm i -g vercel bun
```

```shell
yarn global add vercel bun
```

```shell
npm i -g vercel bun
```

Strongly suggesting also degit so you can get a clean version when you start a new project without git history.

```shell
pnpm i -g degit
```
